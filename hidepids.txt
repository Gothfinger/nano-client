Don't worry, there's no need to access that file or anything, just do the following.
    Start Apex
    Wait until you're in main menu
    Open terminal
    Run this command: sudo sysctl -w kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=2
    Run this command: sudo mount -o remount,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hidepid=2 /proc
    Start nano-client

When you close Apex again, follow these steps to undo it so you can properly launch Apex the next time:
    Close Apex
    Open terminal
    Run this command: sudo sysctl -w kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=1
    Run this command: sudo mount -o remount,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hidepid=0 /proc
